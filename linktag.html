            Infopark, Kochi is an information technology park situated in the city of Kochi, Kerala, India. Established in 2004 by the Government of Kerala,[3] the park is spread over 260 acres (105.2 ha) of campus across two phases, housing 541 companies which employ more than 62,500 professionals as of 2022.[2]

The Phase 1 campus is fully developed spread over a 101 acres (40.9 ha) with more than 7 million sq ft (650 thousand m2) of operational built-up space. Infopark Phase II is spread over 160 acres (64.7 ha) of campus area which would have a total built-up space of 8 million sq ft (740 thousand m2) upon completion and is expected to employ more than 100,000 professionals.[4]

The Infopark campus currently has 9.2 million sq ft (850 thousand m2) of built-up area and is the major contributor of IT export revenue from the state of Kerala.[5] IT exports from Infopark which stood at ₹32 billion (US$400 million) in 2016–17, doubled in a period of 4 years, rising to ₹63.1 billion (US$790 million) in 2020–21.[6] A huge real estate boom was triggered soon after Infopark started to attract big MNCs from around the globe. Infopark changed the landscape and lifestyle of Kochi, particularly the Kakkanad area. A new culture got evolved and more and more commercial and residential ventures started to rise up which then extended the limits of Kochi city to further north end.[7]

The park is built on the 'Hub and Spoke model' for the development of the Information Technology industry in Kerala. Infopark acts as the hub to the spokes located at Thrissur and Cherthala.
